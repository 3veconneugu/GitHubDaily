Black magic, or *Kala Jadu* (Ú©Ø§ÙØ§ Ø¬Ø§Ø¯Ù) in Urdu, is a form of magic that involves invoking evil spirits and using negative energies to harm others. Black magic can be used for various purposes, such as causing illness, death, divorce, poverty, madness, or bad luck. Black magic can also be used to influence someone's mind, will, or emotions, such as making them love or hate someone, or making them obey or disobey someone.
 
Black magic is forbidden in Islam, as it is considered a major sin and a form of shirk (associating partners with Allah). The Quran and the Sunnah warn against the dangers of black magic and its practitioners, who are called magicians or sorcerers. The Quran says: "And they followed [instead] what the devils had recited during the reign of Solomon. It was not Solomon who disbelieved, but the devils disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was revealed to the two angels at Babylon, Harut and Marut. But the two angels do not teach anyone unless they say, 'We are a trial, so do not disbelieve [by practicing magic].' And [yet] they learn from them that by which they cause separation between a man and his wife. But they do not harm anyone through it except by permission of Allah. And the people learn what harms them and does not benefit them. But the Children of Israel certainly knew that whoever purchased it would not have in the Hereafter any share. And wretched is that for which they sold themselves, if they only knew." (Quran 2:102)
 
The Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him) said: "Whoever blows on knots practices magic, and whoever practices magic is a mushrik (polytheist)." (Tirmidhi) He also said: "Avoid the seven destructive sins." They asked: "O Messenger of Allah! What are they?" He said: "Shirk with Allah; sorcery; killing a soul which Allah has forbidden killing except with right; consuming riba (usury); consuming an orphan's wealth; fleeing from the battlefield; and slandering chaste women who are unaware." (Bukhari and Muslim)
