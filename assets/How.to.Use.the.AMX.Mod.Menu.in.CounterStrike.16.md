## How to Access the AMX Mod Menu
 
To access the AMX Mod Menu, you need to have admin privileges on the server. You can either be the server owner, or have an admin account with a password. You also need to have the AMX Mod X plugin installed on the server. You can download it from [here](https://www.amxmodx.org/downloads.php).
 
Once you have admin privileges and the plugin installed, you can access the AMX Mod Menu by typing "amxmodmenu" in the console. Alternatively, you can bind a key to this command by typing "bind <key> amxmodmenu" in the console, where <key> is any key you want to use. For example, if you want to use F1 as your AMX Mod Menu key, type "bind F1 amxmodmenu" in the console.</key></key>
 
## How to Use the AMX Mod Menu
 
When you access the AMX Mod Menu, you will see a list of categories with numbers next to them. These categories are:
 
- Admin Commands: These are commands that allow you to kick, ban, slay, slap, pause, change map, change cvar values, and execute other commands on the server.
- Chat Commands: These are commands that allow you to send messages to all players, all admins, or a specific player through normal chat, HUD messages, or private messages.
- Vote Commands: These are commands that allow you to start a vote for a map, a kick, a ban, or a custom poll.
- Stats Commands: These are commands that allow you to view your stats, other players' stats, top 15 players, and your rank on the server.
- Say Commands: These are commands that allow you to display information such as next map, time left, and current time.
- Menu Commands: These are commands that allow you to access other menus such as stats configuration menu, configs menu, language menu, plugin command menu, plugin cvar menu, and speech menu.

To select a category, type its number in the chat box and press enter. For example, if you want to access the Admin Commands category, type "1" in the chat box and press enter. You will then see a list of commands with numbers next to them. To select a command, type its number in the chat box and press enter. For example, if you want to kick a player named John from the server, type "1" in the chat box and press enter to access the Admin Commands category, then type "1" again in the chat box and press enter to select the kick command. You will then be prompted to enter the name or #userid of the player you want to kick. Type "John" or "#userid" (where #userid is John's userid) in the chat box and press enter. You can also optionally enter a reason for kicking John after his name or #userid. For example, type "John Cheating" or "#userid Cheating" in the chat box and press enter.
 
To go back to the previous menu or exit the AMX Mod Menu altogether, type "0" in the chat box and press enter.
